# Baker Rush

This is my first attempt to teach little kids how to code. I plan to further this project to entice specifically 
3rd to 5th graders (smallest demographic in STEM). The command box takes in custom python functions: left(), right(), up(), down().

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
